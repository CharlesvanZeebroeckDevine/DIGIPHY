# Coding Exploration

## Week 1

During week 1, I (Wander) tried to see if a fake 3D parallax panning effect was possible to do for a hero image. I investigated PixiJS, a 2D WebGL renderer that works great to do the thing we might want to do with the hero section. 

I also tried to add some logic and made folders for different tests, so we can document everything smoothly. For our pitch we wanted to show a little demo of what I made for the hero section, so we deployed this folder to Vercel (https://digiphy-zeta.vercel.app/). This way we can easily show what we have done to the client, so they are already able to interact with it.

Next on the list is investigating React Three Fiber, Next.js, Lenis for scroll animations and Babylon.js to see what our possibilities are.
